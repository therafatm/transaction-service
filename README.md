# transaction-service

This project is the core business logic for a toy day trading system built as part of a higher year class at school.
You can find more information about the complete system [here](https://github.com/therafatm/Dank-Stocks-Inc).
This service is essentially a REST API written in Golang, built with postgres, redis, and rabbitmq.
